		<p>It all started with a spark that gave birth to humanity, the moment the universe would begin to bend to our wills. We were just simple creatures with sharp sticks and a want for more.As a result we formed small groups and although our species was weak alone, we stood strong in numbers. We elected wise kings to lead our newly born nations and crafted flags adorned with the symbols of our various religions and ideologies. We came from sharp sticks that transformed into deadly blades to slay our enemies and with every continent conquered adding to our lust for more. Monuments stood long after our civilizations as a reminder of a golden era swept away by time.</p>

<p>Blades and Calvary soon transformed into guns and armored vehicles, war machines that screamed and whistled across the battlefield. It was a race to see who had the biggest stick and before we knew it we had the power to destroy each other with the push of a button. The global fear of nuclear death raining down on our heads rendered the classic eras of war unprofitable spawning a time of extended peace not seen for decades.</p>

<p>The present is not too different from our past it seems as we’re still fighting, a never ending tug of war between us and our curiosity for the unknown. The weapons we once used to destroy one another now allows us to reach beyond the glassy skies and into the even horizon. With each generation’s pass we built upon each other mistakes forming new ideas and theories about our ever expanding universe. With our rapid growth in the recent years coupled with our short temper its amazing that we haven’t completely annihilated each other. Touching the cosmos we’re right back where we started.</p>
