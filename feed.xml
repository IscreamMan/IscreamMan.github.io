It was the same cycle every day going to a job that filled my soul with loathe and rage, torturing every atom of my being as each second ticked away. It felt like I was chained to this idea of a honey pot that stood at the end of the rainbow when in fact I could lose this so-called steady job and end up in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world felt cold; I was a part of a machine that gave me enough to keep the gears turning but never once stopped to ask my name. It was all for the money that’s how they catch the majority, paying enough to fuel our obsession with vanity. I was trapped like a rat in a golden prison selling my soul to impress my cellmates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the edge of a cliff and the end of my rope I was given a choice, either keep my job and drift slowly into the realms of insanity or starve to death creating something that I truly enjoyed. Either way, the chance of failure was equal at both ends but at least doing what I loved would allow the ship to sink on my terms. As I lay here on this wooden bench, gazing at the stars, I pray to the gods I made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The alarm clock screamed for me to wake from my short slumber, its voice piercing the walls of my inner thought.

Efficient calculations made them useful for the sciences while their flashing pixels kept us entertained for generations. We used this modern day magic to establish a consciousness that radiated the entire globe giving every human the ability to coexist in a digital world. We even built screens to these new lands, a gateway to a realm that consumed our attention beyond control. They harvest our thoughts with each click, knowing what we want before we even think. Welcome to the modern era where artificial intelligence has already taken over and humanity is too dumb to realize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are at a point in history where artificial intelligence is still relatively young and our future could go in any direction. Either we nuke each other into oblivion or build machines to do it for us. Most likely when this technology matures enough governments will start using it for militaristic purposes, producing weapons and fueling almost infinite machine armies built in a battery of well-streamlined factories all controlled by one hyper-intelligent AI. We often give enemies the tools necessary to stage our defeat and based on history along with or love for automation this is the most likely direction. Its the biggest fear that surrounds artificial intelligence, to have them forcefully wipe out our entire existence without a second thought. We may win a war against them and even learn something along the way or maybe die at the hands of our creation extinguished at our peak. Whatever the outcome I believe hyper-intelligent AI will completely flip this world on its head and I for one would welcome our new robotic overlords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more optimistic future would include machines doing all the heavy lifting for us in terms of taking over repetitive jobs to give humans more time to focus on science and culture. Instead of doing things we hate and leading miserable lives, we would enjoy our short existence in this universe. Advances may even allow us to fully merge with them and become superhuman leaving behind these weak mortal shells for a more metallic frame. Our carefree culture might lead us into a state where we heavily depend on robots to survive and not able to complete even the most menial of tasks. In the end, artificial intelligence, although risky, is our only shot at ascending beyond mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

I would imagine this was our life before birth, suspended in nothingness and truly at peace. Our modern lives contrast these early beginnings however as even the world we call home was forged in a fiery nest nurtured by chaos. Most of us are born to struggle in the mud lands of our own problems and not many find their escape. Countless get devoured by their demons and those who survive either come out the other side broken or rise to become immortals. This eternal fight is what fueled our species to adapt and achieve greatness beyond comprehension. It’s a lifetime of mistakes that have contributed to the success of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey is long and we often find ourselves lost in the cruel sea of thought, crafting problems in our head before they have the chance to attack. The overwhelming burdens of life force us to look back at the simpler times when the world seemed open and new. We find innocent babies so adorable as they fumble about trying to exist, I wonder if the gods look down upon us thinking the same thing as we try to understand the complex threads that make up the fabric of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we all have potential, like a blank canvas we can all grow into a masterpiece. We humans possess a tool that can mold this world into anything. Never in the history of mankind have we had the power to access knowledge so freely and almost instantaneously. The ability to be everywhere and having a voice that echos the globe would be considered magic a few centuries ago. It makes you wonder what this world will look like in the next hundred years. Will it be a paradise or a technological nightmare? Whatever the outcome lets enjoy this blue rock together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Pitch black darkness.

We were just simple creatures with sharp sticks and a want for more. As a result we formed small groups and although weak alone, we stood strong in numbers. We elected wise kings to lead our newly born nations and crafted flags adorned with the symbols of our ideologies and organizations. We forged sharp sticks that evolved into deadly blades to slay our enemies to gain fame and with each continent conquered it added to the melting pot which was our culture. Monuments stood long after our civilization’s vanish as a reminder of a golden era that crumbled to the dusts of time. Nations are born out of the ashes of these fallen nations heralding the rise of a more modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blades and cavalry soon transformed into guns and armored vehicles, war machines that screamed and whistled across the battlefield. It was a race to see who had the biggest stick and before we knew it we had the power to destroy each other with the push of a button. The global fear of nuclear death raining down on our heads rendered the classic eras of war unprofitable and dead thus spawning an age of peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a never ending tug of war between us and our curiosity for the unknown. The weapons we once used to destroy one another now allow us to reach beyond the glassy skies and into the event horizon. With each generation’s pass we built upon each other mistakes forming new ideas and theories about our ever expanding universe. With our rapid growth in the recent years coupled with our short temper its amazing that we haven’t completely annihilated each other. Touching the cosmos we’re right back where we started, just a curious ape with a lust for more power.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It all started with a spark that gave birth to humanity, the moment the universe would begin to bend to our will.
